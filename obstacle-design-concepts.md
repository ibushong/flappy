# Obstacle Design Concepts

For the "FlappyKipp" game, we need Republican/MAGA-themed obstacles. Here are some design concepts:

## Obstacle Types

1. **MAGA Sign**
   - A pole with a "Make America Great Again" sign
   - Red background with white text
   - Could be drawn as a rectangle on top of a thin pole

2. **Trump Hair**
   - Iconic blonde hair styled like Trump's
   - Could be placed on top of obstacles
   - Instantly recognizable silhouette

3. **Republican Elephant**
   - The traditional Republican party symbol
   - Could be shown holding signs or with MAGA hat

4. **Conservative News Logo**
   - Fox News-style graphics
   - Could be displayed on screens/billboards in-game

5. **Red States**
   - Map outlines of traditionally Republican states
   - Could be colored red and used as obstacle shapes

## Implementation Notes

- For each obstacle, create both a top and bottom version
- Keep the designs simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes
- Use bright colors (especially red) to make obstacles stand out
- Political imagery should be recognizable but not overly detailed

Remember that the obstacles should be visible both at the top and bottom of the screen, with a gap in between for the player to navigate through.

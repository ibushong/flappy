# FlappyKipp

A "Flappy Bird" clone with a political twist, where the player (a Democrat) has to avoid Republican-themed obstacles.

## How to Play

1. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to start the game.
2. Press the Space key or tap the screen (on mobile devices) to make the character flap.
3. Avoid hitting the politically-themed obstacles.
4. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Assets

The game works without any external assets, using fallback colored rectangles for all game elements. However, for a more personalized experience, you can add the following images to the `assets` folder:

- `player-normal.png` - Default face/character image
- `player-flap.png` - Face/character when flapping
- `player-hit.png` - Face/character when hitting an obstacle
- `obstacle-maga.png` - MAGA-themed obstacle
- `obstacle-trump.png` - Trump-themed obstacle
- `obstacle-republican.png` - Republican-themed obstacle

You can use any images you like for these, just make sure they're named correctly and placed in the `assets` folder.

## Development

The game is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no external libraries or frameworks required.

To modify the game:
- Edit `game.js` to change game logic
- Edit `styles.css` to change the appearance
- Edit `index.html` to change the structure
